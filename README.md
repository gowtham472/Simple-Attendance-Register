# Project: Attendance and Registration System

## Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to manage student registration and attendance for "HOLY ANGELS MATRICULATION HR. SEC. SCHOOL". The system includes the following key files:

### Files and Their Functions:
1. **register.html**
   - **Description**: This is the main registration page where users can input their name and ID number to register.
   - **Key Elements**:
     - A form for inputting the user's name and ID number.
     - Buttons to submit the registration form or close the form, redirecting to the attendance page.
     - Linked to `register.php` for backend processing.
     - Uses `register.css` for styling.

2. **register.css**
   - **Description**: This file contains the CSS styles for the registration form.
   - **Key Elements**:
     - Styling for input fields, buttons, and the layout of the registration page.
     - Use of external fonts from Google Fonts.
     - Background styling with gradients and media queries for responsiveness.

3. **register.php**
   - **Description**: This script handles the backend processing for the registration form.
   - **Key Elements**:
     - Processes the form data submitted via `register.html`.
     - Connects to a database to store the registration details.
     - Provides feedback to the user on the success or failure of the registration.

4. **attendance12.php**
   - **Description**: This script is designed to handle attendance data.
   - **Key Elements**:
     - Retrieves and displays attendance records.
     - Provides functionality to update or delete attendance records.
     - Linked from the registration form's "Close" button.

5. **attendance12(1).php**
   - **Description**: A variation of the `attendance12.php` script, likely for a different part of the attendance functionality or for testing purposes.

## How to Use
1. **Registration**:
   - Navigate to `register.html`.
   - Fill in the required fields: Name and ID Number.
   - Click "Update" to submit the form.
   - To exit, click the "Close" button to return to the attendance page.

2. **Attendance**:
   - Navigate to the attendance page linked from the registration form.
   - View, update, or delete attendance records as needed.

## Dependencies
- PHP for backend processing.
- A web server (e.g., Apache) to serve the PHP files.
- A database (e.g., MySQL) for storing registration and attendance data.
- Internet connection for loading external fonts in `register.css`.

## Installation
1. Upload all PHP files (`register.php`, `attendance12.php`, `attendance12(1).php`) to your web server.
2. Place `register.html` and `register.css` in the appropriate directory accessible by your server.
3. Ensure your server is configured to process PHP files and that a database is set up for registration and attendance data.
4. Open `register.html` in a web browser to start the application.

## Customization
- **Styling**: Modify `register.css` to change the look and feel of the registration page.
- **Form Fields**: Edit `register.html` to add or remove input fields as needed.
- **Backend Logic**: Adjust `register.php` and `attendance12.php` to fit your specific database schema or add more functionality.
